            <h2>About My Work</h2>
            <p>My research combines technology and mental health care, exploring how digital tools can improve treatment approaches in addiction science. I develop and test evidence-based interventions to reduce the burden of addiction and mental health issues, especially among vulnerable populations. By finding what actually works and why, I aim to create practical solutions with real impact.</p>
            <p>I hold a Psychology degree from the University of Crete, a Research Master's in Clinical and Developmental Psychopathology from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and a Ph.D. from the same university, where my research focused on digital mental health interventions.</p>

            <h2>Current Positions</h2>
            <p>I apply my expertise in two roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since 2021, I've been a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <strong>Swiss Research Institute for Public Health and Addiction (ISGF)</strong> in Zurich. Here, my work centers on evaluating digital interventions targeting addictive behaviors through methods like randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.</li>
                <li>In 2024, I also became Co-Head of Research and Quality Assurance at the <strong>Centre for Child and Youth Forensics (ZKJF), University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich</strong>. This position expands my focus to include youth forensic mental health, investigating the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches for young people within the justice system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Research Focus</h2>
            <h3>Digital Health Interventions & Addiction</h3>
            <p>At the ISGF, I evaluate digital tools designed to help individuals modify harmful behaviors and enhance their wellbeing. My interest lies in identifying the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of these interventions and exploring strategies to maintain user engagement over time. My work encompasses both substance use and behavioral dependencies, utilizing clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to determine treatment efficacy. I am particularly intrigued by the complexities of polysubstance use and the potential for digital solutions to augment traditional treatment methods.</p>

            <h3>Youth Forensic Mental Health</h3>
            <p>My role at the ZKJF involves dedicated research concerning young people in forensic mental health settings. This challenging field, situated at the intersection of youth development, mental health, and legal systems, raises unique questions that guide my investigations. I focus significantly on addressing addictive behaviors among justice-involved youth. Research indicates high prevalence rates: approximately 84% of youth in juvenile facilities report prior drug use, and about 60% meet criteria for a substance use disorder in the year before custody. Yet, only around 28% of these detained adolescents access treatment services. These figures underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions addressing the interplay between substance use, mental health, and criminal justice involvement in this population.</p>

            <h2>Let's Work Together</h2>
            <p>I am always keen to connect with fellow researchers, clinicians, and innovators who share interests in digital health, addiction science, and youth forensic mental health.
